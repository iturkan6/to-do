## The idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to build a Trello-like application that's useful for managing tasks digitally instead of writing them down on paper. 

## How everything should work: 
The algorythm that a new user should follow consists of the following:

1) Open the login page, choose the `Create account` option
2) Get redirected to the `Sign Up` page, fill in the form and press the `Create account` button
3) Get redirected to the login page, enter the newly created credentials and press `login`
4) Get redirected to the `Landing page`, where the user can press the `Get Started` button and get redirected to the `Main page (My Tasks)`
5) Here the user can see his tasks, which he has added using the `Add task` button. He can also sort his tasks by selecting the filter near the `Add task` button. If the user presses the `Delete` button on a task - that task is being transferred to the `Tasks archive page`. However, if he clicks on the `Complete` button - a special `Done` flag is applied to the task and it can be seen by selecting the `Done` filter. If the user clicks on a specific task - he can see its description down below.
6) If the user wants to see the `Tasks archive page` - he may hover onto his icon in the top right corner and choose the `Archive` option. If the user presses the `Delete` button on a task here - a modal window appears alerting the user that this action cannot be undone.

### That's about it. However, there is one thing left. Please keep in mind that the websites are "Work In Progress", which means that some html/css/js files may change during updates. Also you can ask for whatever Front-End feature you want to be implemented and it will be so. Good Luck!
